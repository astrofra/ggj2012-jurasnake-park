#  GGJ2012 Jurasnake Park

_A 2 players game made for the Global Game Jam 2012, Isart Digital, Paris._

The game is implemented in [Squirrel](https://github.com/albertodemichelis/squirrel), based on [GameStart3D](https://www.youtube.com/@GameStart3D/videos).
It was created during the Global Game Jam 2012, where the theme was `Ouroboros`.

:Joystick: Action game created during GGJ2012 at Isart Digital Paris. Two players, the first one controls the jeep, the second one aims the water cannon. The goal is to remain as long as possible on track, avoiding obstacles and collecting different bonuses.

## Devlog

_During the GGJ12, I kept a devlog that was published on the [Game Side Story](https://www.gamesidestory.com/2012/02/03/carnet-de-bord-global-game-jam-2012-paris/) website. Here is it, translated into English._

## 15h30, Friday, January 27, 2012

Arrival at the GGJ, equipped with our t-shirts and badges, we wait in the courtyard of [Isart Digital](http://www.isartdigital.com/) for all participants to arrive. Some faces are familiar, including a VRGeeks team specialist carrying an entire cube of sensors, helmets and other accelerometers.

The majority of the jammers present are men... We still have a bit of a way to go to achieve parity! In the meantime, I'm refining my mini framework under [GameStart](http://www.gamestart3d.com/) (screen change routines, Xbox Paddle reading...)

## 17h

Official launch of the GGJParis.

Olivier Lejade, founder of [MekenSleep](http://www.mekensleep.com/) studio, presents the event and its proceedings, before passing the baton to [Swing Swing Submarine](http://www.swingswingsubmarine.com/), two recognized developers from Montpellier, authors of [Blocks That Matter](http://www.swingswingsubmarine.com/games/blocks-that-matter/) (XBLA, STEAM). They have already participated in previous Jams, and they remind us that while being an indie developer sometimes allows for greater creative freedom, it's not the fastest path to financial independence.

The time for the video keynote arrives, with international accents. Gonzalo Frasca (PowerfulRobot), Brenda Garno (Jagged Alliance), John Romero (Doom), Will Wright (SimCity), Tomohisa Kuramitsu (Baiyon.com) take turns sharing sensitive and touching anecdotes about their respective experiences. Romero & Garno talk about their human collaboration, Frasca talks about the strong link between empathy and work relationships and the importance of improving at every competition, Wright presents his methodology against a background of wandering ants and Kuramitsu surprises us with his DJ Scratching practices using 8bit video cartridges.

At the end of this keynote, rich in wise and valuable teachings, Olivier Lejade announces the theme: it's not a word, but an [image](https://www.gamesidestory.com/wp-content/gallery/contenu-divers/ouroboros-preview.png)... A snake biting its tail, in a cyclical and circular movement, the Ouroboros, for the most literate among us.

Ready, set, go! We have 30 minutes to come up with a concept, which each of us will have to develop and present to the others in 30 seconds. Guaranteed stress, doubled by the difficulty of getting to the point in so little time. I personally won't have time to present my entire concept, which is much simpler than most of the crazy ideas coming from my co-jammers.

Among the ideas that caught my attention, some of which are brilliantly original or hilarious, Alexis Moroz, an experienced game designer I had the opportunity to see in action at the GGJ2011, will propose a concept that will, unfortunately, not be developed. But the end of GGJ2012 Paris will show me how he might be dazzling and efficient!

## 18h (more or less)

The recruitment session is launched. Everyone roams around Isart, a pizza in one hand (perfect catering, as usual with Isart Digital) and their game concept in the other, looking for collaborators.

Teams of 2 or 3 (!) coders are ardently looking for graphic designers, and on the opposite side, game designers & artists are doing everything to bring a coder to work on their project.

For my part, I decide to team up with [Florian Belmonte](http://www.florianb.com/), an illustrator & 2D animator from the same city as me, but with whom I've never worked. He's OK with developing my game concept. The risk is relatively reduced on purpose: it's my first GGJ as a coder and I don't want to sink the ship!

All we need now is to find a sound designer, a task that will turn out to be more complex than expected, Olivier Lejade having planned to integrate a limited number of them into the Jammers' staff. In the end, Eddy is more than happy to join us, knowing that he will have the opportunity to work on 1 or 2 other projects in parallel. The Global Game Jam is also about this: plunging into 48 hours of pure rush with perfect strangers!

After a few hours, as Olivier had announced, the teams are formed. Back to the auditorium, and each team presents the projects that have been collectively selected. No less than 21 games are in gestation, a record for Isart & the GGJ Paris.
